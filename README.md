# Project-MultiDec
Taking into account several detectors 

run projet.R to generate a signal, compute noisy and filtered data in the 3 detectors and draw spectrograms

run inverse_whiteNoise.R to get the estimated hplus and hcross polarizations and their spectrograms from signals with white noise added

run TFMap_realNoise.R to obtain the likelihood maps generated with the method X-Pipeline from signals with simulated LIGO noise
